# se350-project
Final project for the SE350 course at St. Cloud State University, taught by Adriano Cavalcanti.


Authors: Blake Norman and Jordan Levercom

The main purpose of this application was to give users a feed-style 
social media experience. Users can log in with their own username and password,
navigate to a "Feed" screen where they can view posts from all other users on the 
platform, navigate to a "Post" screen where they can create and author their own post,
and a "Profile" screen which displays all the posts that the currently logged-in user 
has created.

The requirements for this project were as follows:
  1. Connectivity (1): The application needs to be running in Google Cloud
  
  2. Data (2): The application needs to allow the user to add, select, and display
  data from a database.
  
  3. Cookies (1): The application needs to collect information based on how the user interacts
  with the application.
  
  4. Security (1): Allow users to register for a new account, login, and logout.
  
  5. Final Feature (2): Integrate GPS, Animation, or ChartKit into the application.

  6. Submission (3): Submit the zipped application, as well as a video demo.

We received a grade of 10/10 on this project.

The application is no longer running on the Cloud, and may need to be demoed using 
a local fullstack development tool, like Xampp or Ampps.
